# puts is the same as saying print string

# variables are created by using a string with an equals sign aftewards, followed by the value, whatever that might be. A value has a datatype associated

# '#{}' is a formatter, or a way of embedding variables into strings for interpolation.

# formatter %  is a way to create a format string but rather than using variables, use values by their names. kind of like kv pairs for multiple values.. seldom but it could come in handy

# new lines and escaping a quote can be handled with \n and %q { text }

# many other escape sequences \" \a \b \f \t \uxxxx etc

# triple single or triple double ''' """ can also be used

# gets.chomp get string from input gets.chomp.to_i transform to an integer _s to a string _float or to a float

# ARGV get argument variable from command line
# gets.chomp from user input while the program is running
# $stdin.gets.chomp when you're utilizing ARGV and inputs

# open(to_file, 'w') writer, reader files
