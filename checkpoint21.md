# puts is the same as saying print string

# variables are created by using a string with an equals sign aftewards, followed by the value, whatever that might be. A value has a datatype associated

# '#{}' is a formatter, or a way of embedding variables into strings for interpolation.

# formatter %  is a way to create a format string but rather than using variables, use values by their names. kind of like kv pairs
